# Lux Engine

Lux Engine is an experimental C++20 graphics engine built to explore modern rendering pipelines with a strong focus on subsystem modularity.


## Key Features
- **OpenGL rendering** with a configurable pipeline and custom GLSL shader suite (`assets/Shaders`).
- **Custom data structures** for scenes, graphs, and sparse sets (`include/Data Structures`, `include/Renderer`).
- **Cross-platform event and input layer** (`include/Event`, `include/Input`, `src/Input`).
- **Profiling and logging** via `Application/Profiler`, `Application/Logger`, and `spdlog`.
- **Multi-platform build support** (macOS, Linux, Windows) using CMake ≥ 3.27 and a C++20 toolchain.
- **Optional GoogleTest suite** (`src/Test`, `ENABLE_TESTING`, `RUN_TESTS` flags).

## Requirements
- CMake 3.27 or newer
- C++20 compiler (Clang 16+, GCC 12+, MSVC 2022)
- Python 3.10+ (only if you plan to use `scripts/setup.py`)
- OpenGL packages and developer tools:
  - **macOS**: Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`)
  - **Linux**: `build-essential`, `cmake`, `libgl1-mesa-dev`, `xorg-dev`
  - **Windows**: Visual Studio 2022 with Desktop development with C++

All third-party dependencies (GLFW, GLEW, GLM, glslang, SPIRV-Tools, spdlog, GoogleTest) live in `thirdparty/`, so no external installations are required.

## Repository Structure
- `src/` – engine source code (renderer, application system, input, scene).
- `include/` – public interfaces and reusable components.
- `assets/` – sample models, textures, and shader programs.
- `images/` – logos and promotional artwork referenced by the documentation.
- `scripts/` – bootstrap scripts for shell, Python, and Windows environments.
- `build/` – directory generated by CMake (safe to regenerate).
- `Docs/` – auxiliary resources, including CMake helpers for documentation.

## Build (macOS & Linux)
```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --parallel
```

Run the binary:
```bash
./build/LuxEngine
# or, depending on the generator:
./build/bin/LuxEngine
```

## Build (Windows)
```powershell
cmake -S . -B build `
      -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" `
      -A x64 `
      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --config Release
```

Run from the Visual Studio Developer Prompt:
```powershell
.\build\Release\LuxEngine.exe
```

## Useful CMake Options
- `-DENABLE_TESTING=ON|OFF` toggles the GoogleTest targets (default: ON in Debug).
- `-DRUN_TESTS=ON|OFF` runs automated tests before launching the app (default: ON in Debug).
- `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug|Release|RelWithDebInfo` selects the build profile for single-config generators.

Debug example with tests:
```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DENABLE_TESTING=ON -DRUN_TESTS=ON
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build
```

## Setup Scripts
- `scripts/setup.sh` – prepares a Unix/macOS environment (packages, build generation).
- `scripts/windowsSetup.bat` – installs the minimum prerequisites on Windows.
- `scripts/setup.py` – Python helper to automate custom steps (clean, configure, build, run).

## Assets and Images
3D assets and textures are stored in `assets/` and can be replaced with your own resources. Images in `images/` (logo, splash, promo art) are referenced directly in this README for presentations and documentation.

## Known Issues
- Vulkan is disabled by default on macOS; the engine currently forces OpenGL (`GRAPHICS_API_OPENGL`).
- Some shader pipelines require OpenGL 4.5–compatible hardware and up-to-date drivers.
- The `build/` directory can grow quickly; use `cmake --build build --target clean` or delete it when switching toolchains.
